# Exploring CharBERT
```markdown

This project explores the use of CharBERT by fine-tuning it on different pre-trained language models (PLMs) and applying named entity recognition (NER) on various versions of CharBERT across different datasets.
```
## Overview

CharBERT is a character-aware pre-trained language model designed to improve the performance of NLP tasks by incorporating character-level information. This project aims to:

1. Fine-tune CharBERT on different PLMs.
2. Evaluate CharBERT's performance on NER tasks.
3. Compare results across different datasets and versions of CharBERT.

## Installation
Clone the repo:
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/developer-sidani/CharBERT.git
```

To run the notebook, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets

The following datasets are used in this project:

- [CoNLL-2003](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/)
- [AG News](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626)
- [WNUT 2017](https://noisy-text.github.io/2017/emerging-rare-entities.html)
- [wikipedia simple](https://huggingface.co/datasets/legacy-datasets/wikipedia)

## Usage

The main steps to run the project are as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the datasets.
2. **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune CharBERT on the selected PLMs.
3. **NER Evaluation**: Apply CharBERT to NER tasks and evaluate performance.
4. **Results Comparison**: Compare the performance across different datasets and CharBERT versions.

### Running the Notebook

To execute the notebook, follow these steps:

 **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
